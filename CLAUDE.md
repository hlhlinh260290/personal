# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Repository Status

This repository is currently empty with no existing codebase. When development begins, this file should be updated to include:

### Common Commands
- Build commands
- Test execution commands
- Linting and formatting commands
- Development server startup

### Architecture Overview
- High-level project structure
- Key architectural patterns
- Important design decisions
- Framework and technology choices

### Development Workflow
- Branch naming conventions
- Commit message format
- Code review process
- Deployment procedures

## Notes for Future Updates

This CLAUDE.md should be updated as soon as:
1. A project framework is chosen (React, Node.js, Python, etc.)
2. Build tools are configured (webpack, vite, cargo, etc.)
3. Testing framework is set up
4. Linting/formatting tools are added
5. Key architectural decisions are made

The goal is to help future Claude Code instances quickly understand the project structure and common development tasks without having to discover them through exploration.
