Why did the developer break up with their code?

Because it had too many commitment issues!

But don't worry, they're back together now - they just needed to add some source code to make their relationship more stable! 💻❤️

P.S. I guess you could say they're now... fully committed! 😄

BONUS DAD JOKE:

Why do programmers always add source code before going to bed?

Because they want to make sure their dreams are well-documented! 😴💻

And if their code doesn't work, at least they can sleep on it! ZZZ...
